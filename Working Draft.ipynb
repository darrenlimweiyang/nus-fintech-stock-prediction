    "3. Combined_News_DJIA.csv: To make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns. The first column is \"Date\", the second is \"Label\", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from \"Top1\" to \"Top25\".\n",

    "To me, this is a interesting business problem. We all know that the happenings of the world affect the markets. I believe this to be a good first step in attempting to discovering the impact of news on the markets. \n"
