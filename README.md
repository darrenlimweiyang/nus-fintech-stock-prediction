We worked together on this project previously. I would like to take a deeper dive into the libraries and techniques used. 
The aim of this project is to improve my ability to work with textual data and gain a better grasp of sentiment analysis. In this accompanying notebooks, I have applied a machine learning model onto the dataset.

# Further Action

Once I have completed the main bulk of it, I aim to take a deeper dive into the various methods of sentiment analysis. I have only used *vader* for now, but I am looking forward to try non-lexical methods of sentiment analysis.

Thank you!
